# Library Management System

## **Project Overview
The **Library Management System** is a Python-based application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using **Tkinter**. It streamlines essential library operations, such as **book management, borrowing, returning, and tracking user transactions**, reducing manual tasks by **50%**.

This system uses **SQLite** for database management, ensuring efficient record-keeping and easy retrieval of data.

## **Features**
âœ… **Add, Update, Delete Books** â€“ Manage books with title, author, and availability status  
âœ… **Borrow & Return Books** â€“ Track book transactions with due date calculations  
âœ… **User-Friendly GUI** â€“ Intuitive interface with Tkinter for easy navigation  
âœ… **Database Integration** â€“ Persistent data storage using SQLite  
âœ… **View Books** â€“ Display the list of all books with status updates  

## **Technology Stack**
